# Arduino_analoggraph_LEDmatrix
This repository contains the arduino code necessary to take an analog input 
and graph it on a type 7219 LED matrix using the MaxMatrix library.
Additional Modules can be daisy chained on the same bus and accounted for in the sketch.
Future features may include things like waveform analysis of audio signals, the ability to stack multiple 7219 modules in parallel as well as in series and different graphing techniques. Watch this space!
